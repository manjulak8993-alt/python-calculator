# Simple Calculator in Python  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a *basic calculator program* written in Python.  
It allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations like *addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division* through a text-based menu-driven interface.  

## The program demonstrates the use of:  
- *Functions* (to structure code for each operation)  
- *Loops* (to repeatedly ask for input until the user decides to exit)  
- *Conditional statements* (to choose operations based on user input)  
- *Error handling* (division by zero case)  

## 🛠 Features  
- Add two numbers  
- Subtract two numbers  
- Multiply two numbers  
- Divide two numbers (with error handling for division by zero)  
- Menu-driven interface with options (1–5)  
- Exit option to safely stop the program  

## Example Run

--- Simple Calculator ---
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1/2/3/4/5): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 15
